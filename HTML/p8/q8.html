        Millions of people worldwide suffer from diseases that lead to paralysis. Research in neural
        prosthetic devices has substantially grown over the past few years to combat this condition.
        These devices allow links to be made between the nervous system and the peripheral world by
        decoding neural signals from the brain and effectively translating them into limb movements.
        NeuroLife is an experimental device that aims to treat paralysis by creating an artificial link
        between the brain and the body.
